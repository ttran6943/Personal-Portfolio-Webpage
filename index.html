        <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>I am a UCLA Bruin, pursuing a degre in Geology, B.S. While I share a profound interest in the earth and the mechanisms of it, I realize I have also developed a passion for coding. I had the privilege at UCLA to use C++ and Python in various applications, such as simulating kinematic geologic sequences and structures, from which I found my interest in programming. My goal is to one day be a part of a life-changing programming project for the bettering of our daily lives.</p>
          <p>Aside from Geology and coding, some other of my interests are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hiking and camping</li>
              <li>Astrophotography, portrait photograpgy, and landscape photography</li>
              <li>Volunteering and community service</li>
              <li>Spending quality time with family and friends</li>
            </ul>
          <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer and/or looking to collaborate, please contact me! I always look forward to working with other developers to build great softwares!</p>
